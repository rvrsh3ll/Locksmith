    .SYNOPSIS
        This function asks the user a set of questions to provide the most appropriate remediation for ESC1 issues.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function takes a single ESC1 issue as input then asks a series of questions to determine the correct
        remediation.

        Questions:
        1. Does the identified principal need to enroll in this template? [Yes/No/Unsure]
        2. Is this certificate widely used and/or frequently requested? [Yes/No/Unsure]

        Depending on answers to these questions, the Issue and Fix attributes on the Issue object are updated.

        TODO: More questions:
        Should the identified principal be able to request certs that include a SAN or SANs?

    .PARAMETER Issue
        A pscustomobject that includes all pertinent information about the ESC1 issue.

    .OUTPUTS
        This function updates ESC1 remediations customized to the user's needs.
